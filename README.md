The dataset also covers details such as business travel frequency, department, education level, and field of study.

Additionally, tenure-related fields such as the number of years an employee has spent at the company and in their current role are included.

Attrition by Gender: Male employees have a higher attrition rate (63.29%), suggesting that men are more likely to leave than women.

Attrition by Years at Company: Attrition peaks for employees with around 1 year at the company, indicating that early tenure employees are most likely to leave.

Attrition by Education Field: Life Sciences has the highest attrition (37.55%), revealing a potential issue with retaining employees from this educational background.

Job Satisfaction by Role: Managers and sales executives exhibit lower job satisfaction, which could be contributing to higher attrition in these roles.
